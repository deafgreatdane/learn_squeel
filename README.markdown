# Learn Squeel

This application contains examples that can be used to tinker with the features of
the wonderful [Squeel gem](https://github.com/ernie/squeel)
which makes complex SQL queries intuitive and more Ruby-like. It's one thing to read
reference documentation to learn a framework, it's another to have actual data and models to
experiment with while you're learning it.

# Installation
